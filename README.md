This will become a Project with Experiments
of Theory of Consonance. The whole Theory of
Music is based on the Theory of Consonance 
and Dissonance. But in Music there was ever
a Problem to discribe Consonance and
Dissonance in Theoretical Terms. Music
is more based of the Sensual Experience
of Musicians then of Theories.
So it is common that Consonance will
be discribe with different Theorical
bases. So this Project will lead to a
Set of this Theories in Practical 
Experiments. I hope anybody will become
inspired by this Experiments to do own
Experiments.
